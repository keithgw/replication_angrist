```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r libraries}
library(foreign) # read .dta files
library(dplyr)   # data wrangling
setwd('~/Econometrics/replication/replication_angrist/')
```

## Load the Data  
```{r load data}
data_file <- '../Angrist1993Replication.dta'
angrist <- read.dta(data_file) %>% 
    as_data_frame() # pretty printing
```

## Replicate Table 1 Data Set  
```{r sample set}
angrist <- angrist %>%
    filter(
        # no females
        female == 0,
        # Vietnam and early AVF Veterans
        viet_era == 1 | early_avf_era == 1, 
        # Aged 30-54 in 1987
        age_cat > 27 & age_cat < 57,
        # 1 - 15 years of active service
        !is.na(years_serv_cat),
        # less than 9 years of schooling when entering the military
        entgrade >= 9,
        # non-negative increment in schooling between military entry and schooling
        grade_inc >= 0
    )

# demonstrate that the data set matches the sample
print(angrist)
```

## Get Summary Statistics  
```{r frequency distributions}
# counts and frequency by age
(
by_age <- angrist %>%
    group_by(age_cat) %>% 
    # get summary statistics
    summarise(count = n(), 
              percent = round(n() * 100 / nrow(angrist), 0)) %>% 
    # add age labels from metadata
    bind_cols(data_frame(age_label = names(attr(angrist, 'label.table')$labage)), .)
)

# counts and frequency by years of service
(
by_service <- angrist %>% 
    group_by(years_serv_cat) %>% 
    summarise(count = n(),
              percent = round(n() * 100 / nrow(angrist), 1)
              ) %>% 
    # Note the author does not use IEEE rounding rules, 
    # so 38.5 is rounded improperly in the paper
    mutate(percent = ifelse(percent %% 2 > 0 & percent - floor(percent) == 0.5,
                            ceiling(percent),
                            round(percent, 0)
                            )
    )
)

# counts and frequency by branch of service
(
by_branch <- angrist %>% 
    # missing values implicitly removed in the paper
    filter(!is.na(branch)) %>% 
    group_by(branch) %>% 
    summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    mutate(percent = round(count * 100 / sum(count), 1)) %>% 
    # again replicate non-IEEE rounding on 17.5
    mutate(percent = ifelse(percent %% 2 > 0 & percent - floor(percent) == 0.5,
                            floor(percent),
                            round(percent, 0)
                            )
           )
)
